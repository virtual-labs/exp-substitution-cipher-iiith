**STEP 1 :** For the given ciphertext in the **PART I** of the experiment page, the first step is to generate ciphertext by clicking on the "Next CipherText" button.

**STEP 2 :** Calculate frequencies of generated ciphertext by clicking on "Calculate Frequencies in Ciphertext" button

**STEP 3 :** Copy the generated ciphertext from **PART I** and paste in "Scratchpad" area of **PART II**

**STEP 4 :** Analyse similarties between "Calculated Frequencies Table" and "English Alphabet Frequencies Table"

**STEP 5 :** Based on similarities,try to make a frequency based estimation for each character of ciphertext

**STEP 6 :** Replace characters of CipherText in Scratchpad with a character estimated previously using a **Modify** function of **PART II**

**STEP 7 :** Based on Hints from Ciphertext in "Scratchpad" area make more replacement of ciphertext characters

**STEP 8 :** Repeat **Step 7** till you get a meaningful English Text

**STEP 9 :** Finally, observe the deciphered plaintext in Scratchpad Area,if a meaningful English text is formed cut-and-paste it in the text-field named "Solution Plaintext" of **PART III**. Also enter the final character mapping in the"Solution Key" in **PART III** and click on "Check Answer" button.

**STEP 10[OPTIONAL] :** Verify that your answer is correct, by encrypting the solution plaintext with your key in **PART IV**.
